    <p class="pmain"> Why go outdoors? </p>
    <div class="divsub">
    <p class="smallp">This a page based off personal expirence, facts and why you should try exploring more of Manchester and it's greenspaces, if you already hike, bike or run, other pages will be of better use. <br><br> The benefits of hiking are clear to me as someone who was previously overweight, it's not ideal for to feel insecure about their weight, so if you are, I know personally that you don't have to be. I was able to lose it by hiking 20 minutes outside the Stockport area and visiting country parks, an hour away is the peak district, which you can see in the photos I took on this website. <br> In my opinion, as someone able to lose weight without changing my diet, food isn't the key to losing weight, it's just a small peice in the larger puzzle, I only exercised once a week for 4 or 5 hours, walking around beautiful mountians and reserviors, it definitely feels better than dieting and most people would have 4 hours of leisure in a week, as well as the mental and finanicial benefits may be better than gyms.</p> <br>
    <p class="smallp">There are plently of articals that show the scientic correlation between being outside and stress relief, happiness as well as better physical/mental health, the US national Libarary of medicine agrees, they say there is strong link between neighbourhoods with good greenspace and health, this is because the existance of greenspace encourages physical excercise, aestetically, greenspace looks nicer than suburban areas so people are more compelled to go for a walk or cycle through them, the mere sight of trees have been shown to be a positive stimulus for the brain. <br> Another important factor is sleep, physical excercise and greenery can make you sleep better and easier, scientically, the department of evironmental conservation in New York has compiled many schollarly articles on the topic. <br> Sources: <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562165>USNationalLibararyofMedicine.gov</a> <a href=https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/90720.html>DepartmentOfEvironmentalConverationNewYork.gov</a> </p> <br>
    <img src="images/reddish.jpg" alt=Picture-reddish>
    <p class="smallp">I hope this would convince you of the importance of greenspace, why it's ideal for you to try going outdoors and understand why I think it's so important for you to try an outdoor hobby like cycling, the benefits will show over time. </p>

      <p class="smallp"> Located in Tameside, this country park is a good place for horse riding, cycling and having a picnic. It is easily accessable with plently of foot paths, mostly wheelchair friendly and 3 car parks.

    <p class=smallp> Althrough there's so many more parks, country parks, national parks, not every one of them can be mentioned here, it would simply be too much to sort through since Greater Manchester is a large place worth exploring yourself</p>

    <p class=smallp> This website was made because of Hubbub, an organisation that is built around positive change, there was given 3 topics from Hubbub, this website is focused on Mancunians exploring their local greenspaces, it's good for mental health and it is good for local businesses. This is the link to their site <a href= https://www.hubbub.org.uk/what-we-do> Hubbub.org </a> </p>

    <p class=smallp> Another reason why this website has it's subject around people going outsite, people are statically very lazy, more and more people only go outside when they have to for school or work and it's not to anywhere nice either. I hope that more people know the benefits of going outdoors, for their mental health, physical health</p>
